The goal of Residence Relief is to provide people with an easy way to view housing options and communicate with Housing Providers. Clients can create an account as a Housing Provider to list their housing as a potential Rental option. Or clients can create an account as a potential Tenant to view current listings and communicate with housing providers to create an agreement.
